buildah is a remarkable alternative to build container images. I am just a beginner at the moment so I collect some scripts here while I am learning and testing.

My basic concept is:
- learn to use buildah on the command line and in scripts
- learn advanced features such as networking, pods
- learn podman and skopeo usage
- run buildah scripts with jenkins
- configure and deploy using ansible
- orchestration of containers based on buildah and podman
- understand differences to docker
- learn shortcommings, bugs or restrictions
